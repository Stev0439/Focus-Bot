<u>Sprint 1:</u>

During this time the team worked primarly on research. While we had discussed bots in class and the group members all had some familiarity with traditional web development as with websites, none of the team members were familiar with creating chrome extensions. 

We took this time to learn more about Chrome extension specifically and see what differences, if any, existed between what we were familiar with and the new material to make developing the bot easier. We also spent time importing and refactoring a template of a working Chrome extension in order to expidite future development.

We did not use Github's Project Board at this time, and have no screenshots of the tasks set or completed.

Tasks set at start of sprint:
- Create Chrome extension base
- Create Main Menu for bot
- Create base menu for each major functionality
- Research Chrome APIs and functinoalities.

Tasks completed at end of sprint:
- Create Chrome extension base
- Create Main Menu for bot
- Research Chrome APIs and functionalities

Tassk incomplete at end of sprint:
- Create base menu for each major functionality

Our reflection lead us to believe that our tasks would be fairly simple. With a template in place, we believed that the future sprint would be able to complete future tasks in time and create a proof-of-concept by the end of the 2nd sprint. We also took note of several functionalities and APIs to help complete our tasks.

<u>Sprint 2:</u>

At the beginning of the sprint we discussed the basic components of the application and worked out who would be given what work. The work breakdown as discussed between group members looked like this:

  Gabriela
- Music/Noise Technique
- Pomodoro Technique

Erick
- Reminders

Steven
- Encouragement Techique

All
- CSS
- Main Menu

Tasks at start of Sprint:

Note: We wrote up these general ideas on our project board. However, we did not turn them into issues as it was clearly understood between group members who was doing what. Thus they weren't turned into issues and officially assigned until much later.

Tasks at end of sprint:

As one can see by the end of Sprint 2, we were able to finish each use-case functionality that was set out to be done, with the exception of the pomodoro tequnique which will be implemented in the polishing before the final submission. The polishing of adding css and more JS to the bot in order to make the user interface much cleaner will be implemented in the polishing before the final submission. 

Looking back, we could have set out to have better management in our time and github use, as we ended up taking more time in just getting the bot off the ground as we would of liked, delaying the implementation of the use-cases. Overall, we feel that the team is in a good spot to present a demo in a week and have a polished version of the bot in the next two weeks.
