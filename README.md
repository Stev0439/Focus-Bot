A major problem found in any workplace is low team member productivity which results in late work and missed deadlines. These problems cause the stereotypical pitfalls faced by many teams of extending schedules past their promised deadlines. Such extensions cause major losses for companies in increased cost of project and work hours billed, disappointment of customers, and lagging behind market competitor product roll out. All of these aspects can massively hinder the potential success of a project and total profit it returns to the company.

Our focus bot would be used to increase team member productivity by solving the problem of avoiding late work and missed deadlines. This would avoid the stereotypical pitfalls many teams face of extending schedule past their promised deadlines, which cause major losses for companies in increased cost of project and work hours billed, massively hindering the potential success of the project. Thus the idea of our bot is to increase this productivity by getting workers to start projects earlier and keep them actively engaged in their projects during working hours. As such we would be looking at a focus bot focused on the patterns of notifiers and space responders to accomplish these tasks.

The focus bot has conversations with the users as well as responds to events. The bot allows the user to set specific tasks and reminders that are used as a checklist. The user is able to interact with these reminders in order to stay on task and keep track of their work. The bot also has a function to display encouraging messages over in a loop to keep the user motivated when the user selects that mode. Furthermore, the bot and the user interact with each other in the Pomodoro Focus Technique, in which the user sets a time to focus and the bot displays the time left in focus. The bot also sends notifications to the user after certain events happen, such as completing all the daily reminders, alerting the user after being idle for a period of time, or finishing their Pomodoro Focus Technique.
