<ins>Problem / Bot Application<ins> 

A major problem found in any workplace is low team member productivity which results in late work and missed deadlines. These problems cause the stereotypical pitfalls faced by many teams of extending schedules past their promised deadlines. Such extensions cause major losses for companies in increased cost of project and work hours billed, disappointment of customers, and lagging behind market competitor product roll out. All of these aspects can massively hinder the potential success of a project and total profit it returns to the company.

Our focus bot would be used to increase team member productivity by solving the problem of avoiding late work and missed deadlines. This would avoid the stereotypical pitfalls many teams face of extending schedule past their promised deadlines, which cause major losses for companies in increased cost of project and work hours billed, massively hindering the potential success of the project. Thus the idea of our bot is to increase this productivity by getting workers to start projects earlier and keep them actively engaged in their projects during working hours.
